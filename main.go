	//this will print out the memory address of the value - a pointer
	//go is a garbage collected language
	//Pointers can have a benefit when you have structs containing lots of
	//data. When you have these, the overhead of the garbage collector might
	//be negated by the overhead youâ€™d get when copying large amounts of data.
	//Reasons to use pointer:
	//The only way to mutate a variable that you pass to a function is
	//by passing a pointer
	//WHen you do not do this, you pass a copy and not a reference to the origina value.

	//EG
	createPerson()            //Still print out Richard, as we do not change original value
	createPersonWithPointer() //This works
